# TS229 Project Summary - ADS-B Receiver
![Example of Trajectory](https://rdebache.fr/assets/img/Tache7trajectoire.png)
## Project Overview

This project involves developing a real-time ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) receiver using software-defined radio and MATLAB. Students implement a complete signal processing chain including PPM modulation, temporal/frequency synchronization, CRC encoding/decoding, and aircraft position frame decoding. The final objective is to create an application similar to FlightRadar24 capable of displaying real-time aircraft trajectories within a reception radius around the school. The project covers all aspects from the physical layer to the final application with 3D trajectory visualization.

## Practical Applications

This system can be applied for:

* **Local air surveillance**: Air traffic control at airports or sensitive areas
* **Search and rescue**: Locating aircraft in distress
* **Traffic analysis**: Statistical studies of air corridors and route optimization
* **Security**: Detection of aerial intrusions in protected zones
* **Training**: Educational tool for understanding aeronautical communications and signal processing

## Technical Implementation

The project is structured in 12 progressive tasks covering:

### Core Components
* **Physical Layer**: PPM modulation, signal processing, synchronization
* **Channel Coding**: CRC implementation for error detection
* **MAC Layer**: Frame structure decoding and aircraft data extraction
* **Application Layer**: Real-time visualization and trajectory tracking

### Key Features
* Real-time signal processing at 1090 MHz
* Doppler effect compensation
* Multi-aircraft tracking with ICAO address identification
* 3D visualization with altitude information
* Distance calculation between receiver and aircraft

## Mathematical Tools & Signal Processing

### Digital Signal Processing Techniques

* **Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)**: Binary encoding with 1Î¼s symbol period
   - $p_0(t)$ for bit '0' and $p_1(t)$ for bit '1' impulse functions
   - Signal reconstruction: $s_l(t) = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} p_{b_k}(t - kT_s)$

* **Correlation-based Synchronization**: Cross-correlation for time delay estimation
   - $\rho(\delta t') = \frac{\int y_l(t)s_p^*(t-\delta t')dt}{\sqrt{\int |s_p(t)|^2dt \cdot \int |y_l(t)|^2dt}}$

* **Maximum Likelihood Detection**: Optimal decision rule for noisy channels
   - Decision metric: $\|\mathbf{r}_k - v_0[0,1]\|_2^2 \lessgtr \|\mathbf{r}_k - v_0[1,0]\|_2^2$

### Mathematical Frameworks

* **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**: Welch periodogram for signal characterization
   - $\Gamma_{s_l}(f) = \mathcal{F}\{\tilde{R}_{s_l}(\tau)\}$ where $\tilde{R}_{s_l}(\tau)$ is the averaged autocorrelation

* **Cyclostationary Analysis**: Processing periodic signal structures

* **CRC Polynomial**: $p(x) = x^{24} + x^{23} + x^{22} + \ldots + x^3 + 1$ for error detection

* **CPR Decoding**: Compact Position Reporting algorithm for latitude/longitude extraction
   - $\text{lat} = D_{\text{lat}_i}\left(j + \frac{\text{LAT}}{2^{N_b}}\right)$ with geographic zone calculations

### Signal Processing Chain

* **Sampling**: 20 MHz sampling rate with oversampling factor of 20
* **Matched Filtering**: Optimal reception using correlation with known preamble
* **Frequency Compensation**: Doppler shift correction for moving aircraft
* **Bit Error Rate (BER)**: Performance analysis as function of $E_b/N_0$
* **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second latency for live aircraft tracking
