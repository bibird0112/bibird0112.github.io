# TS229 Project Summary - ADS-B Receiver

![Image](https://rdebache.fr/assets/img/Tache7trajectoire.png)
## Project Overview

This project involves developing a real-time ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) receiver using software-defined radio and MATLAB. Students implement a complete signal processing chain including PPM modulation, temporal/frequency synchronization, CRC encoding/decoding, and aircraft position frame decoding. The final objective is to create an application similar to FlightRadar24 capable of displaying real-time aircraft trajectories within a reception radius around the school. The project covers all aspects from the physical layer to the final application with 3D trajectory visualization.

## Practical Applications

This system can be applied for:

* **Local air surveillance**: Air traffic control at airports or sensitive areas
* **Search and rescue**: Locating aircraft in distress
* **Traffic analysis**: Statistical studies of air corridors and route optimization
* **Security**: Detection of aerial intrusions in protected zones
* **Training**: Educational tool for understanding aeronautical communications and signal processing

## Technical Implementation

The project is structured in 12 progressive tasks covering:

### Core Components
* **Physical Layer**: PPM modulation, signal processing, synchronization
* **Channel Coding**: CRC implementation for error detection
* **MAC Layer**: Frame structure decoding and aircraft data extraction
* **Application Layer**: Real-time visualization and trajectory tracking

### Key Features
* Real-time signal processing at 1090 MHz
* Doppler effect compensation
* Multi-aircraft tracking with ICAO address identification
* 3D visualization with altitude information
* Distance calculation between receiver and aircraft

## Mathematical Tools & Signal Processing

### Digital Signal Processing Techniques
* **Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)**: Binary encoding with 1μs symbol period
  - p₀(t) for bit '0' and p₁(t) for bit '1' impulse functions
  - Signal reconstruction: s_l(t) = Σ p_bk(t - kTs)
* **Correlation-based Synchronization**: Cross-correlation for time delay estimation
  - ρ(δt') = ∫ y_l(t)s_p*(t-δt')dt / √(∫|s_p(t)|²dt · ∫|y_l(t)|²dt)
* **Maximum Likelihood Detection**: Optimal decision rule for noisy channels
  - Decision metric: ||r_k - v₀[0,1]||² ≶ ||r_k - v₀[1,0]||²

### Mathematical Frameworks
* **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**: Welch periodogram for signal characterization
  - Γ_sl(f) = F{R̃_sl(τ)} where R̃_sl(τ) is the averaged autocorrelation
* **Cyclostationary Analysis**: Processing periodic signal structures
* **CRC Polynomial**: p(x) = x²⁴ + x²³ + x²² + ... + x³ + 1 for error detection
* **CPR Decoding**: Compact Position Reporting algorithm for latitude/longitude extraction
  - lat = Dlat_i(j + LAT/2^Nb) with geographic zone calculations

### Signal Processing Chain
* **Sampling**: 20 MHz sampling rate with oversampling factor of 20
* **Matched Filtering**: Optimal reception using correlation with known preamble
* **Frequency Compensation**: Doppler shift correction for moving aircraft
* **Bit Error Rate (BER)**: Performance analysis as function of Eb/N₀
* **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second latency for live aircraft tracking
